## Umami Tracking Events

### Tool-Related Events

   - Metadata: page, static_tools_count, dynamic_tools_count
2. **tool-clicked**: When user clicks on any tool
   - Metadata: tool_status, tool_price, authentication status

### User Identification

- Automatic identification when users log in
- Comprehensive user properties tracked
- Queued identification if Umami loads after login

## Environment Variables Required

```env
VITE_UMAMI_WEBSITE_ID=your-umami-website-id
VITE_UMAMI_SRC=https://analytics.umami.is/script.js
VITE_UMAMI_ENABLED=true  # For development tracking
```

## Design System Updates
